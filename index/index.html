    <p> Memories are what I hold dearest to me as I look back at these beautiful days and reminisce about the good old times.
      This image captures my Junior year at Univerity of Hartford with my best friend, Lovia. We both knew each other in high school and it's
    crazy to me how we both came to the same college. From there our friendship bond became stronger and filled with laughter. Find out more in the About me section!
