      <p> Hello and welcome to Julexi's world! My name is Julie and this is my personal blog where I like to express how I truly feel.
        Every other week on Friday's I like to talk about a certain subject whether it may be sharing personal adventures with friends, beauty care,
       fashion, financial stability or even lifestyle.</p>
       <p> If you're somebody who likes to read and enjoy other people's blogs for fun feel free to learn more about it <a href="about.html">here</a> or go to the About me section at the top left of the website.
         Hope to see you there!
